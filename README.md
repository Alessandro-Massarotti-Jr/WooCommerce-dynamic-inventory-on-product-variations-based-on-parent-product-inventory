<h1>WooCommerce Variation stock based on parent stock</h1>

<p>This function causes the stock of product variations to be based on the stock of the parent product according to the stock value that a variation represents for example: a variation that represents 20 products will remove 20 units from the parent's stock and the stock of this same variance will be the parent product's total inventory value divided by 20.</p>
